# Ex2 (B) Priority Queue
## DATE: 19/03/2025
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1.  Start
2.  Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
3.  Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
4.  Print each element of the array during the loop.
5.  After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.
6.  End 

## Program:
```

/*#include<stdio.h> int size = 0;
*/
voidprintArray(int array[], int size)
{
int i; for(i=0;i<size;i++)
{
printf("%d ",array[i]);
}
printf("\n");
}
 
*/
```
